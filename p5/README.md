## Neighborhood Map project

This project displays a Google map with markers for several locations. The page also includes a list of locations.

### How to Use

To use the Neighborhood Map, click on index.html or navigate to http://ctirpak.github.io/p5/index.html

The page can be used much like a typical Google map, allowing the user to scroll, zoom and pan. Street view is also available.

Each marker contains an info window that is visible when clicking the marker. The info window displays links with summaries from Wikipedia.

There is a search box located at the top of the page, where you can search for a location in the list. As you type, the list will narrow, showing only those results which match. The matching characters are highlighted in red.

Clicking on an item in the list, centers the map at that location and opens the info window.
