##is an HTML5 Canvas game. [Click here to play the game](http://ctirpak.github.io/p3/index.html), or open your web browser and navigate to http://ctirpak.github.io/p3/index.html

##**How to play**
---
The object of the game is to score as many points as possible. To do this, you
must move your character across the screen and reach the water without getting
killed by the bugs. There are several items that will appear which will give you
additional points or lives.

##**Controls**
---
To move your character, use the arrow keys or alternatively you can use
'W' 'A' 'S' 'D' to move up, left, down, or right.

To change your character, use the numbers 1 through 5 to pick a different avatar.

To pause the game, press the 'P' key.

To start a new game, press the 'R' key. Note: this only works after your game has ended.

##**Scoring**
---
Items appear randomly throughout the game for a limited amount of time
before disappearing. Each item has a base score value plus an additional
bonus modifier. The bonus modifier is added to the score and is based on the
amount of time left before an item disappears. The sooner you get an item, the
higher the bonus modifier.

There is an additional bonus modifier that is added to the score when you reach the
water. This is based on the amount of time spent in the active game area. The
active game area is anywhere except for the first starting row. If you go back
to the starting row, the bonus modifier is reset. The longer the amount of time
spent in the active game area, the higher the bonus.

* Gems (any color)			25
* Keys						75
* Hearts					100 plus an additional life
* Stars						125
* Stones					125
* Reaching the water		100

##**Hints**
